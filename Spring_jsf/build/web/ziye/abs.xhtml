                        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We are a new Internet shopping supermarket.
                        
                        <br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of 1999, with the advent of the Internet boom. The number of online shopping users in China is increasing. In 2010, China's online shopping market continued the double growth trend of user scale and transaction scale. 
                        <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 2010, the transaction scale of China's online shopping market was close to 500 billion, reaching 498.0 billion yuan, accounting for 3.2% of the total retail sales of social consumer goods; at the same time, the scale of online shopping users reached 148 million, with a penetration rate of 30.8% among Internet users (according to the statistical data of 2013-2017 China online shopping industry market forecast and investment forecast analysis report). 
                        <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For some traditional enterprises, it is difficult to form any significant changes to the current market through some traditional marketing means. If you want to completely open the sales channels of enterprises, enterprises must introduce new thinking and new methods. Online shopping just provides a good opportunity and platform for the traditional enterprises nowadays.
                        <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Traditional enterprises try online shopping one after another by means of the third-party platform and the establishment of their own platform. Building a reasonable online shopping platform, integrating channels and improving the industrial layout have become the focus and outlet of the future development of traditional enterprises.
                        
                        <br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Looking forward to the future development trend of online shopping industry, we think we can think from several dimensions.
                        <br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;First, from the perspective of consumers, in the future, online shopping will not only penetrate more groups, but also change the consumption habits and ideas of users. Online shopping will gradually evolve into a natural habit and become an important part of Internet users' online life.
                        <br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Second, from the perspective of enterprises, the application of e-commerce in enterprises is still the general trend in the future. The networking process of production and sales of traditional enterprises will be accelerated, and the number of traditional enterprises testing direct online or distribution will rise rapidly.
                        <br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Third, from the perspective of industry segmentation, subdivision will still be the main trend of B2C in the future. A large number of small and medium-sized b2cs continue to emerge, and characteristic b2cs will gain growth space.
                        <br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth, from the perspective of enterprise competition, the future marketing war of e-commerce enterprises will continue, and the marketing strategy will directly determine the survival space of new and old enterprises in the market; in addition, the improvement of details (including shopping process, customer service, logistics, etc.) is also the focus of the lasting improvement of e-commerce platform.
